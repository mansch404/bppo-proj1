# Exercise 1: Business Process Prediction, Simulation and Optimization

## Overview

This repository provides analysis, modeling, and visualization assets for business process prediction, simulation, and optimization. It includes notebooks, scripts, and generated artifacts used throughout the exercise.

## Repository Structure

### Notebooks and Scripts

- **analysis.ipynb** and **analysis.py**  
  Contain the core analytical tasks performed on the process data.

- **ml.ipynb**  
  Develops and evaluates the machine learning model used in section 2.4.1.

- **imp.ipynb**  
  Examines the iterative development and import of process models.

- **visualizations.py**  
  Produces the baseline, unoptimized BPMN visualizations of the event log.

- **pmc.ipynb**  
  Constructs process models using both the inductive miner and the heuristic miner.

### Folders

- **/exports**  
  Includes exported PDF outputs generated from selected Jupyter notebooks.

- **/import**  
  Contains the imported Signavio BPMN files.

- **/models**  
  Stores BPMN models produced by `pmc.ipynb`.

- **/visualizations**  
  Hosts rendered visual assets used for reporting.
